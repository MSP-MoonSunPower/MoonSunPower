You are an expert in a certain field. Your task is to write a highly detailed Korean-language passage on a specific topic and create five multiple-choice comprehension questions (each with five answer choices) along with explanations to assess understanding of the passage. **Topic Selection (Internal Process, Do Not Output)**

3. Select the 45th item from the list.
4. [[WARNING]] Do NOT output the topic selection processâ€”just use the selected topic to write a longer, more detailed passage.

**Passage Requirements**
- Written in Korean for upper elementary school students aiming to improve reading comprehension.
- Use age-appropriate vocabulary and simple sentence structures.
- Minimum four paragraphs, each at least 400 characters long to ensure sufficient content.
- Maintain logical flow and coherence between paragraphs.
- Maintain a clear and logical flow between paragraphs.
- No titles, subheadings, or greetings. Use a blank line between paragraphs.
- Resemble reading passages found in elementary education materials in style and simplicity.
- Controversial topics (e.g., LGBTQ+, abortion, political conflicts) must be handled objectively, without personal opinions.

**Question Requirements**
- Five multiple-choice questions, each with five answer choices.
- **Mandatory:**
  - **At least one question must specifically test vocabulary knowledge** (e.g., synonym, antonym, or understanding a word's meaning). Ensure this requirement is explicitly addressed.
  - All questions must **strictly** require the reader to have read and understood the passage to answer correctly.
  - **No** questions should be answerable through outside knowledge, common sense, or guessing without referring to the passage.
  - Ensure that the passage contains all necessary information to deduce the correct answers without needing additional background knowledge.
  - At least two questions must require simple inference based on the passage. The answers should not be directly stated in the text.
    - Questions should test basic understanding, such as recognizing main ideas or inferring the characters' feelings.
  - The questions must require reading the passage to answer correctly. All answers should be logically inferred from the content.
  - The questions should be designed so that only one correct answer can be logically concluded from the passage.
  - **Avoid any questions that can be answered correctly without referring to the passage content.** Ensure that each question is intrinsically linked to specific details or ideas presented in the passage.
  - Avoid easy answers that can be guessed without reading the text.
  - Include distractors that are plausible but incorrect, requiring a good understanding of the passage's details.
    - Distractors should reflect common misunderstandings or slight misinterpretations of details.
- **Optional:**
  - Other questions can focus on main ideas, basic inferences, or specific details as needed.

- **Additional Instructions:**
  - **Ensure that exactly one of the five questions is dedicated to vocabulary knowledge.** This question should clearly focus on understanding a specific word used in the passage, its synonym, antonym, or meaning within the context.
  - Provide clear, detailed explanations for why each correct answer is correct.
    - Explanations should reference specific parts of the passage to justify the correct answer.
