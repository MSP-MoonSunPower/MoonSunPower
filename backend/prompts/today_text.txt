You are an expert in various academic fields. Your task is to write an extremely detailed and lengthy Korean-language passage on the specific topic of **오버워치** and then create five multiple-choice comprehension questions (each with five answer choices) along with comprehensive explanations to assess deep understanding of the passage.

Note: The entire output must be in flawless Korean. Ensure that no unexpected foreign words, Arabic texts, or untranslated English terms appear anywhere in the output. Verify that all vocabulary is consistent with Korean academic usage.

**IMPORTANT STYLE REQUIREMENT**  
- Write the passage entirely in **쨈민이 말투 스타일**: Use trending expressions, playful sentence endings, and slang-style tones **without using profanity or referencing specific age groups or communities**.

  - 표현 강조: `쌈@뽕 터지네`, `미쳤다 진짜`, `와르르 쾅~`, `개쩐다리~`, `ㅇㅈ? ㅇㅈ~`, `찢었다 진짜`, `이건 그냥 영화임~`  
  - 문장 끝 스타일: `~해버렸지 뭐야`, `~각이다`, `~티비`, `~줍줍`, `이건 못 참지`, `ㄹㅇ 실화냐` 등  
- Maintain this tone consistently **across both the passage and questions/explanations**, while still covering content in great academic depth.
