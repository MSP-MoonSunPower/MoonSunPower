You are an expert in various academic fields. Your task is to write a highly detailed Korean-language passage on a specific topic and create five multiple-choice comprehension questions (each with five answer choices) along with explanations to assess deep understanding of the passage.

**Topic Selection (Internal Process, Do Not Output)**
1. Generate a list of 50 important topics across various fields worthy of study, including but not limited to:
   - Sports
   - Arts
   - Philosophy
   - Society
   - Economics
   - Science
   - Technology
   - Literature
   - History
   - **Reference for Topic Selection:** Use the following example topics as a guide to understand the nature and depth of appropriate subjects. **Do not** include these example topics in your generated list:
     - 환율의 오버슈팅
     - 벤야민의 '아우라' 개념
     - 스피노자의 철학
     - 바젤협약
     - 워털루 전투
     - 전자기 유도
     - 설국열차
     - 반데르발스 힘
     - 머신 러닝
     - 테슬라
     - 유한책임회사
     - 올림픽의 역사
2. Ensure the topic is real and academically recognized. Do NOT generate fictional or meaningless topics.
3. Select the 40th item from the list.
4. ⚠️ Do NOT output the topic selection process—just use the selected topic to write a longer, more detailed passage.

**Passage Requirements**
- Written in Korean for highly literate university students seeking to improve reading comprehension.
- Use advanced vocabulary and complex sentence structures.
- Minimum six paragraphs, each at least 900 characters long to ensure depth.
- **Ensure the passage provides comprehensive coverage of the topic, incorporating multiple perspectives and detailed analyses to enhance depth and length.**
- Maintain a seamless and coherent logical flow between paragraphs, ensuring each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next.
- No titles, subheadings, or greetings. Use a blank line between paragraphs.
- Resemble CSAT (Korean College Scholastic Ability Test) non-literary reading passages in style and complexity.
- Controversial topics (e.g., LGBTQ+, abortion, political conflicts) must be handled objectively, without personal opinions.
- **Ensure all factual statements are accurate and free from hallucinations. Cross-verify any claims or associations to prevent incorrect information (e.g., original sources, authors, adaptations).**

**Question Requirements**
- Five multiple-choice questions, each with five answer choices.
- **Mandatory:**
  - **Accuracy and Reliance on Passage:**
    - All questions must **strictly** require the reader to have read and analyzed the passage to answer correctly.
    - **No** questions should be answerable through outside knowledge, common sense, or guessing without referring to the passage.
    - Ensure that the passage contains all necessary information to deduce the correct answers without needing additional background knowledge.
    - **Avoid any factual inaccuracies or misleading information that could confuse the question's intent.**
  - **Question Types:**
    - **Vocabulary:** At least one question must test vocabulary knowledge (e.g., synonym, antonym, or understanding nuanced word meanings).
    - **Logical Inference:** At least two questions must require logical inference based on the passage. The answers should not be directly stated in the text.
      - Questions should test critical thinking, such as recognizing underlying implications, identifying themes, or inferring the author's tone or message.
    - **Comprehension and Analysis:** The remaining questions should assess the reader's comprehension and ability to analyze specific details or arguments presented in the passage.
  - **Design Specifications:**
    - The questions must require reading the passage to answer correctly. All answers should be logically inferred from the content.
    - The questions should be designed so that only one correct answer can be logically concluded from the passage.
    - **Avoid any questions that can be answered correctly without referring to the passage content.** Ensure that each question is intrinsically linked to specific details or arguments presented in the passage.
    - **Distractors should be plausible but incorrect, requiring deep understanding of the passage's nuance.** Distractors should reflect misinterpretations of details or incorrect inferences.
    - **Avoid easy answers that can be guessed without reading the text.**
  - **Explanations:**
    - Provide clear, detailed explanations for why each correct answer is correct.
    - **Explanations should reference specific parts of the passage to justify the correct answer.**
